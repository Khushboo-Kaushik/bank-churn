# Bank Churn Prediction  

This project aims to predict customer churn in a bank using machine learning models. By analyzing customer data, the model identifies patterns and key factors contributing to churn, helping banks improve customer retention strategies.  

## Features  

- **Input Data:** Customer demographics, account details, transaction history, etc.  
- **Output:** Binary classification indicating churn (`1`) or no churn (`0`).  

## Tech Stack  

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Stramlit
- **Optional Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow/PyTorch or Googlecolab

## Workflow  

1. **Data Collection:** Import dataset (e.g., CSV file with customer data).  
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values.  
   - Encode categorical variables.  
   - Normalize/scale numerical features.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize key trends and correlations.  
4. **Model Training:**  
   - Split data into training and test sets.  
   - Train models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
   - Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
5. **Model Deployment (Optional):** Serve predictions via a web app or API.  

## Results  

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set, with a recall of YY% for churn prediction.  

## Usage  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   cd bank-churn  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the main script:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  
- Integrate advanced models like neural networks.  
- Deploy the model on streamlit
- Real-time data processing and prediction.
